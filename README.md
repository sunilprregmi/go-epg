# DH GO Public EPG

## Overview

The **DH GO Public EPG** project is designed to automatically fetch Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data, process it, and generate XML files that can be used by platforms or applications to display TV program schedules. This process is automated using GitHub Actions, ensuring that the EPG data is updated daily without manual intervention.

This project fetches data from an external API, processes it into an XML format, and creates both an uncompressed and compressed version of the XML file.
